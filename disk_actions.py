"""Deleting a disk item the way its kind is meant to go, and the _MEI clean-up Zyraena does when she
starts.

plan(item) only says how (nothing runs): a Steam game -> steam://uninstall/<appid>; a program (or a
python.org Python) -> its own uninstaller; the pip / uv cache -> `pip cache purge` / `uv cache clean`;
a venv and every other re-downloadable folder -> deleted for good; Temp -> its files older than a day;
the owner's own files and projects (and unknown folders) -> the Recycle Bin. Protected items,
shortcuts and folders that only hold other items have no plan. execute() does it; the panel asks the
owner first and lists what goes with the item and what breaks.

clean_mei(): the exe is built with PyInstaller --onefile, which unpacks itself into Temp\\_MEI<n> and
deletes that folder on a normal exit, but not when the process is ended by force. At start Zyraena
deletes the leftovers: only PyInstaller's (base_library.zip inside), at least an hour old, never her
own, and never one that is still in use: a running exe's loaded DLLs can't be opened for writing,
and renaming the folder fails while a file in it is open.
