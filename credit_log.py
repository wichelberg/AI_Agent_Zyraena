"""API credit log: what each paid request cost and what it was for (the Ctrl+F1 panel's Credits tab).

One entry is one thing the owner asked for: a text-box message with all its tool rounds, a Telegram
message, a spoken turn, a voice note transcribed on OpenRouter, the disk scan's question to Gemini.
Code that makes paid requests wraps them in `activity(source, what)`; every OpenRouter response then
adds a round with the cost OpenRouter reports for it (usage.cost) and its tokens (`record`), and the
tools the model called (`note_tool`).

Around each entry the OpenRouter balance is read before the first request and again after the last,
so the panel shows before - after next to the reported cost. OpenRouter lowers the balance about a
minute late, so "after" is read AFTER_DELAYS seconds later, again until it has moved. When entries
overlap in time (one starts before another's "after" was read) their balance differences overlap
too: the entry is marked. Tavily: its
remaining credit is read before an entry's first web search and after the entry ends.

Stored in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Zyraena\\credit_log.sqlite (ZYRAENA_CREDIT_LOG moves it).
