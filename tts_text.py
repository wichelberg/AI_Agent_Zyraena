"""Text prep for the local Turkish TTS (Chatterbox): what it should say, sentence by sentence.

- Numbers become Turkish words, since the model reads digits badly ("17:30" came out as
  "yün yeti müsırda"): times, percentages, decimals, plain numbers. A suffix written after an
  apostrophe already follows how the number is said, so it is just joined on: "17:30'da" ->
  "on yedi otuzda", "5'te" -> "beşte".
- English names Zyraena says often are respelled the way they're said in Turkish
  ("Claude Code" -> "Klod Kod"); PRONOUNCE holds them.
- sentences() cuts a reply into pieces read one by one, so the first can play while the
  next is made. Very short pieces are joined to the next one (choppy otherwise) and very long
  ones are cut at commas (the model drifts on long inputs). The first piece is kept short so
  the first sound comes early: Chatterbox takes ~2.5 s for 3-4 words and ~4 s for 10.
