"""Sleep mode: the owner hands over a job before going to bed and Zyraena sees it through alone.

The owner confirms once when the job starts; after that nothing waits for permission.

1. Backup. Every project in Documents\\Projects and Documents\\Work (not only the job's) is
   copied to Documents\\Failsafe\\<date>_<job>\\ before anything starts, so whatever changes has
   its "before" copy. If the disk can't hold it all, only the job's folders are copied and the
   report says so. While working, sleep_hook.ps1 (a Claude Code PreToolUse hook) copies any
   project folder not copied yet before its first change, and any file outside those roots
   before Edit/Write changes it. .venv, venv, node_modules and __pycache__ are left out
   (requirements.txt rebuilds them).
2. Work. Claude Code runs headless in "auto" permission mode: it doesn't ask, while a
   safety check still stops destructive or out-of-scope actions. It's told that a failed
   first attempt is part of the job: investigate, find its own solution, and explain why
   in the report. If it stops without saying the job is done, it's resumed and told to
   keep going (up to MAX_ROUNDS times).
3. Report. Each backed-up folder is compared with its copy (added / changed / deleted files);
   copies of folders that didn't change are deleted again. The report, with Claude Code's
   own account of what it did and why, is saved in every changed folder and in the
   Failsafe folder, and sent on Telegram.
4. The PC shuts down, with the usual 60-second warning that /iptal cancels.

The Telegram bridge folder (claude_comm, holds the bot token) and .env files are off-limits.
The PC is kept awake while the job runs.

The owner may also tell a Claude Code session directly "I'm going to sleep, sleep mode". That
session then follows the same rules through this file's command line (see the bottom):
`start` turns sleep mode on and backs up the job's folders, the global hook
~/.claude/hooks/zyraena_sleep_gate.py then runs sleep_hook.ps1 before each change, and
`finish` writes the report, sends it on Telegram and shuts the PC down.
