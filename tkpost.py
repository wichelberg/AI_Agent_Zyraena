"""Handing work to a Tk thread without waiting for it.

Zyraena has several Tk roots, each on its own thread (the pet, the text box / panel, the alerts).
tkinter's root.after() called from another thread doesn't return until the owner thread has taken
the call, so one Tk thread calling into another waits for it, and if that one is meanwhile waiting
for the first (a SendMessage to its windows, its own call back), both hang. That froze the app
twice on 2026-10-21 (the text box during a game, the Disk tab). A Mailbox is a plain queue the owner
thread empties every POLL_MS: post() never waits.
